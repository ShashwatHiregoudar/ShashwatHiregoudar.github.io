Ever woke up from a dream saying damn that didnt end well

A similar thing happened to me

I forgot what the dream was about but i know that didn't end well.

So now whenever im in bed whenever my mind is empty meaning that I am not prefed with thoughts to ponder upon tomorrow. That time this thought strikes again and again.

There was some unfinished business. When i try too hard to remember what it was about i end up spending tooo much time thinking and not sleeing late.

Thinking i didnt sleep much i doze off ðŸ˜œ however ðŸ˜­ i didnt sleep

So i end up sleeping without a dream, restlesss for the next day.

So if anyone knows how to solve this issue of resuming a dream or getting a good nights sleep, do share in the comments section.
