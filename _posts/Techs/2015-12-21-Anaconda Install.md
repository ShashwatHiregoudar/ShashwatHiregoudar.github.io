# Anaconda

## What it is
It is a custom python interpreter.

## Is it necessary for me to install??
A default version of python is already pre-installed in mac and linux os.

But its better to use anaconda because it contains all the required files and libraries pre installed

## How to install 

Simple Go to official anaconda website [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

### Linux / Mac 
    $bash Anaconda*.sh

### Windows
    >Anaconda*.exe
